FEMALE   FLOWER :  gynoecia usually crowded,   sometimes ± distant, ovary subglobose to ovoid or obovoid, 1-4-locular, ovules 1   per locule, anatropous, funicle very short to distinct, erect, placenta   axile to basal, style absent, short or very long, conoid to cylindric, stigma   variably shaped, entire and subglobose or 2-4-lobed, stellate or rarely   punctiform, sometimes large and brightly coloured.   BERRY :    sometimes very large, 1 to   few-seeded, orange to red, rarely blue or white, infructescence ±   cylindric.  SEED :  ellipsoid, testa smooth, thin, embryo   large, somewhat green superficially, endosperm absent.	general	Mayo, S.J., Bogner, J. &amp; Boyce, P.C. 1997.

HABIT : evergreen herbs usually with short, erect to creeping stem,   appearing acaulescent, sometimes stoloniferous, occasionally erect and   climbing.  LEAVES :  several.  PETIOLE :  geniculate apically, sheath   long.  BLADE :  oblong to elliptic or narrowly elliptic,   cuspidate-acuminate;  primary   lateral veins pinnate, running into marginal vein, secondary and tertiary   laterals parallel-pinnate, higher order venation transverse-reticulate.  INFLORESCENCE :  solitary.  PEDUNCLE :  subequal to or longer than petiole.  SPATHE :  oblong, elliptic, ovate or obovate,   cuspidate-acuminate, ± decurrent at insertion, membranaceous to   subcoriaceous, fully expanded, rarely fornicate or clasping, persistent, with   distinct midrib and pinnate primary lateral veins, usually white, rarely green,   turning green in fruit.  SPADIX   :  usually stipitate, rarely   sessile, stipe often partially adnate to spathe, spadix cylindric, erect,   shorter than spathe.  FLOWERS :  bisexual, perigoniate;  tepals 4-6, free, fornicate and almost   truncate at apex, or partly or completely connate into a truncate cup.  STAMENS :  4-6,  filaments short, oblong, flattened,   connective slender, thecae oblong-ellipsoid to ovoid, dehiscing by   longitudinal slit.  POLLEN :  inaperturate, ellipsoid to   ellipsoid-oblong, medium-sized (mean 32 µm., range 27-41 µm.), exine   striate.  GYNOECIUM :  ovoid, subcylindric, obovoid or   flask-shaped, ovary 3-locular, more rarely 2- or 4-locular, ovules 2, 4, 6 or 8   per locule, anatropous to hemianatropous, placenta axile, stylar region usually   long, conic and long-exserted beyond perigone, sometimes shortly attenuate,   sometimes ± truncate and not exserted and inconspicuous, stigma 2-3-lobed   or subcapitate to punctiform.
