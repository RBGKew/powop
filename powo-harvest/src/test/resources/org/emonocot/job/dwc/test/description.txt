LEAVES :  prophylls and cataphylls usually ±   persistent,  entire (membranaceous)   or rotting to a fibrous mass (net-fibrous), sometimes completely   disappearing.  PETIOLE :  geniculate apically (geniculum rarely   well below blade, e.g. <i xmlns=\http://etaxonomy.eu/cdm/model/1.0\>A.   oerstedianum</i>), variously shaped in cross-section, sheath long in   juvenile (monopodial) leaves, very short in sympodial leaves.  BLADE :  small to very large (exceeding 2m),   usually coriaceous, more rarely membranaceous or stiff and brittle,   extraordinarily variable in shape, linear to orbicular in outline, rarely   peltate, entire to trifid or trisect, or pedatifid or subpalmatifid, or   pedatisect to radiatisect, rarely the lobes or segments themselves pinnately   lobed, blade base cuneate to cordate, sagittate or hastate; primary lateral   veins pinnate or more rarely all arising at the base, usually forming one or   more  submarginal collective   veins,  basal ribs often present in   cordate leaves, higher order venation reticulate.  FLOWERING BRANCHES : sympodial units   usually comprising one 2-keeled prophyll, one 1-keeled cataphyll, one   foliage leaf and terminal inflorescence.    INFLORESCENCE : always solitary.  PEDUNCLE :  usually rather elongated, rarely   short.  SPATHE :  usually persistent, sometimes   marcescent or deciduous, usually linear to linear-lanceolate, more rarely   elliptic to ovate, broadly cordate to suborbicular, erect, spreading or   reflexed.  SPADIX :  sessile to long-stipitate, usually   cylindric to conic, more rarely clavate, rarely globose, very short to very long   (over 1m).  FLOWERS :  bisexual, perigoniate;   tepals 4, fornicate, in 2   decussate whorls.  STAMENS :  4, filaments somewhat flattened, usually   equalling tepals at anthesis, sometimes exceeding them, anthers short,   connective slender, thecae ovate to oblong-ovate, dehiscing by longitudinal   slit.  POLLEN :  forate (most often 3-4 pores), more   rarely diporate, rarely inaperturate (sect. <i xmlns=\http://etaxonomy.eu/cdm/model/1.0\>Polyphyllium</i>), spherical to   subspheroidal, small (mean 22 µm., range 14-29 µm.), exine foveolate to   reticulate or subrugulate, rarely tuberculate, muri ± psilate or spinulose,   apertural exine mostly psilate, rarely spinulose.  GYNOECIUM :  ovary ovoid to oblong or obovoid,   2-locular, ovules 1-2 per locule, rarely more, anatropous, hemianatropous or   subcampylotropous, funicle short, placenta axile near apex of septum, style   inconspicuous to attenuated; stigma small, subcapitate, secreting conspicuous   nectar droplet at anthesis.  BERRY   :  variously shaped from globose to   elongate-fusiform, when mature exserted from tepals and usually held dangling by   tiny strips of inner tepal epidermis, sometimes simply falling out of spadix,   2-4-seeded (more in sect. <i xmlns=\http://etaxonomy.eu/cdm/model/1.0\>Tetraspermium</i>), variously coloured, from   conspicuous reds and oranges to dull purplish green, white or blueish.  SEED :   ±  oblong to ellipsoid or subglobose,   sometimes curved, testa usually smooth or somewhat verrucose, thin, usually with   sticky gelatinous mass adhering to raphe, small strophiole sometimes present,   embryo axile, subcylindric to conoid, sometimes curved, endosperm copious.	description	Mayo, S.J., Bogner, J. &amp; Boyce, P.C. 1997.
