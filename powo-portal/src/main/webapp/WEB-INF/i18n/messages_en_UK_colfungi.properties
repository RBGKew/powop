about_body=<p>This work is part of the Useful Plants and Fungi of Colombia (UPFC) project delivered by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in partnership with the Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute.</p>\
<p>It was developed in collaboration with the mycological community in Colombia, including the Colombian Association of Mycology (ASCOLMIC), Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum in Germany, BioMicro of the University of Antioquia, the Group of Taxonomy and Ecology of Fungi of the University of Antioquia (TEHO), University of the Andes, the Research Group in Mycology of the University of Cali (GIM/CICBA), the Research Group in Environmental Sustainability (SUSA) of the University of Los Llanos, the Research Group of Biology and Conservation of the University Pedagógica y Tecnológica in Tunja, the Research Group of Biology and Microorganisms (BPM) of the University of Valle, Colombian Mycology group and the Colombian Group of Lichenology (GCOL).</p>\
<p>The UPFC project aims to enhance nature’s contribution to people in Colombia by:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>Increasing and consolidating knowledge on Colombia’s useful plants and fungi and making it accessible for the benefit of the society.\
<li>Promoting a market for useful native species and their high value natural products and encouraging the sustainable use of natural resources that protects the environment and enhances biodiversity.\
</ul>\

<h2>About POWO</h2>\
<p>Col<em>Fungi</em> is based on <a href="plantsoftheworldonline.org">Plants of the World Online.</a></p>\
<p>In 2015, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew launched its first Science Strategy establishing its vision to document and understand global plant and fungal diversity and their uses, bringing authoritative expertise to bear on the critical challenges facing humanity today. The Science Strategy also committed Kew to delivering nine strategic outputs with the overarching aim to disseminate Kew's scientific knowledge of plants and fungi to maximize its impact in science, education, conservation policy and management. The Plants of the World Online portal (POWO), is one of the nine strategic outputs and its aim is to enable users to access information on all the world's known seed-bearing plants by 2020.</p>\
<p>With over 8.5 million items, Kew houses the largest and most diverse botanical and mycological collections in the world in the Victorian Herbarium and Fungarium in West London. They represent over 95% of known flowering plant genera and more than 60% of known fungal genera and yet, only 20% of this knowledge is available online. POWO is Kew's way of turning 250 years of botanical knowledge into an open and accessible online global resource.</p>\
<p>POWO draws together Kew's extensive data resources including its regional Floras and monographs, alongside images from the digitisation of the collections. The portal has been designed to maximise accessibility and enables the dissemination of plant information to its users via a mobile, tablet or desktop computer.</p>\
<p>POWO was launched in March 2017 with a focus on key tropical African Floras - Flora Zambesiaca, Flora of West Tropical Africa and Flora of Tropical East Africa specifically. Descriptive data from these Floras was linked via a curated taxonomy to images from the digitisation of the collections enabling Kew to finally put a substantial part of these Floras online. In addition, data from Kew's Grassbase and PalmWeb databases have also been included along with species level data for some but not all Orchids.</p>\
<p>It is important to note that POWO is not perfect and represents work in progress - see Limitations below. Ultimately, POWO will become a single point of access for authoritative plant species information, a multi-dimensional catalogue of plant life, including information on identification, distribution, traits, conservation, molecular phylogenies and uses. The codebase is open source and Kew hopes to support existing partner networks to set up their own portals, creating a distributed network of botanical data hubs. POWO aims to become a resource that has global coverage which can empower and inform citizens, policy makers, conservationists and farmers everywhere, about the importance of plants and fungi to life.</p>\
<h2>Limitations</h2>\
<p>Data comes from a variety of sources which are both monographic (global) and regional in scope. These data sources vary in the extent to which comprehensive synonymy is included, their stage of development (proximity to publication) and the degree to which they have been exposed to peer review.</p>\
<p>POWO is a dynamic resource and content is added continuously. By 2020, POWO will be the most comprehensive single information resource covering all plants. We make taxonomic decisions from peer reviewed, curated, authoritative sources where we can, but not in every case. POWO therefore should only be treated as advisory. Other, more authoritative lists may exist for particular regions or taxa.</p>\

<h1>Search Help</h1>\
<p>ColFungi has a free text search with a number of advanced features, which are explained below:</p>\
<h3>Multiple Search Terms</h3>\
<p>Typing a search and hitting "enter" allows you to type a second term in the search bar. These restrict the results of the previous search. (For example, a search for "macrolepiota" and "neotropical" would give a list of all macrolepiota that are found in neotropical environments.) Individual search terms can be deleted by pressing the x on each one.</p>\
<p><a class="document_links" href="/?f=has_images&q=neotropical%2CMacrolepiota">Try multiple search terms here</a><p>\
<h3>Field Search</h3>\
<p>Putting a field name and a colon at the start of your search will restrict the search to the selected field (For example, "author: L." will restrict the search to only taxa that were published by Linnaeus.)</p>\
<p>Currently, you can use the following field names:</p>\
<ul class="column_list">\
  <li>Characteristics:</li>\
  <li>summary</li>\
  <li>appearance</li>\
  <li>characteristic</li>\
  <li>use</li>\
</ul>\
<ul class="column_list">\
  <li>Names:</li>\
  <li>name</li>\
  <li>common name</li>\
  <li>kingdom</li>\
  <li>family</li>\
  <li>genus</li>\
  <li>species</li>\
  <li>author</li>\
</ul>\
<ul class="column_list">\
  <li class="heading">Geography:</li>\
  <li>location</li>\
</ul>\
<p><a class="document_links" href="/?q=author%3A+L.">Try a field search here</a><p></p>\
<p>In addition, ColFungi is part of the UPFC (Useful Plants and Fungi of Colombia) project, and currently holds preliminary information on useful fungi of Colombia. This has come from researchers, previous projects, results from the ColPlantA Internship Program (CIP), visitor researchers (Universidad de los Andes and University College of London), volunteers, and other sources.</p>\
<p>If interested in finding uses, type the word use, followed by ":" and one of the ten first level categories of use of the Economic Botany Standards Data (EBDS).</p>\
<ul class="column_list">\
<li>Use:</li>\
<li>Animal food</li>\
<li>Environmental uses</li>\
<li>Food</li>\
<li>Fuels</li>\
<li>Gene sources</li>\
<li>Materials</li>\
<li>Medicines</li>\
<li>Poisons</li>\
<li>Social uses</li>\
<li>Weeds</li></ul>\
<p>Try a uses search <a href="/?q=use:food">here</a></p>\
<h3>Filters</h3>\
<p>The filter bar allows you to quickly constrain results by some common terms. For example, you can use it to narrow searches down to results with images, or only families, genera or species.</p>\
<p><a class="document_links" href="/?f=has_images%2Cgenus_f">Try a filter here</a></p>\
<h3>TDWG & Geographical Search</h3>\
<p>POWO uses TDWG regions for its geographical search. These are botanical regions that do not necessarily conform to country borders. Continents are searchable, as are continent sections (For example, "Southern South America." covers Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay)</p>\
<p><a class="document_links" href="/?q=Southern+South+America">Try a geographical search here</a><p>
