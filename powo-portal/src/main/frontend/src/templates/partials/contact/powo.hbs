  For further information, to provide feedback, or make an enquiry about POWO, please email us on <a href="mailto:bi@kew.org">bi@kew.org</a>. If like so many of us, you have large number of plant images with which you do very little, then we would be happy to hear from you and will endeavour to incorporate them into POWO under whichever copyright you prefer.

<p>It is important to stress that data are not edited in POWO but only by the contributing datasets, some of which are no longer active. We will forward any specific enquiry to the relevant data providers or you can directly email them yourself. For plant names and distribution, we use WCVP as the names backbone which can be contacted on wcb@kew.org and for Kew herbarium specimen data and images of scanned specimens you can contact HerbCat directly on herbcat@kew.org. Any corrections made by the contribution datasets will be visible on POWO when the data are refreshed.</p>
