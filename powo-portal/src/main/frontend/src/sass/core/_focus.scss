/**
TODO:
- figure out where this code should live
    -> must be up to the declaring / calling code
    -> this needs to expose mixins and sensible defaults
- figure out what these mixins should be called
    -> do we want them to be mixins or classes?
    -> let's have them as mixins - more straightforward than @extend
    -> also what are the names for the different kinds?
        -> in govuk they have 
              $govuk-focus-text-colour
              $govuk-focus-colour
    -> ideas
        - plain-focus           - focus--color
        - text-focus            - focus--coloured
        - focus--text           - focus--bordered
        - focus--primary
        - focus--
- test furiously to find out what we've missed (especially inputs)
- general:
  - see if we can remove !important sufficiently
- buttons:
  - fix the Sort By button not having anything at all selected
  - fix non-pill buttons (there are many)
- inputs
  -
- fix logo SVG
    -> the css for the logo should set the path fill using $kew-focus-text-colour
- remove below styles after checking all of them
